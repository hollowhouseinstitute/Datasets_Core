# Security & Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability or privacy issue (e.g., accidental PII in repo), please follow these steps.

Immediate steps for reporters
1. Do NOT create a public issue.
2. Contact the maintainers securely:
   - Preferred: [maintainer-email@example.org] (replace with a monitored address)
   - If email not available, open a draft/private issue and tag @hollowhouseinstitute (for minimal exposure).

What to include
- A clear description of the issue and how to reproduce it.
- Affected files or datasets.
- Suggested mitigation or steps to resolve.
- Your contact information for follow-up.

Response timeline
- Maintainers will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and provide an initial remediation plan within 14 days.

Handling sensitive data
- If you discover PII or sensitive human-subject data, do not copy or distribute it. Provide the file path and redaction suggestion, then await maintainer instructions.

Legal safe harbor
- We welcome good-faith security research and will not pursue legal action against reporters acting in good faith.

For maintainers
- Triage reported vulnerabilities promptly.
- If required, coordinate takedown and patching, and prepare a public disclosure when safe and appropriate.
